### Hydrangea

Hydrangea is a Markdown-powered blog, made with Flask. Just write your .md files in a folder and deploy the app however you want! No database required.

Markdown conversion is made by the [Markdown package], a Python implementation of [John Gruber's Markdown]. It is almost completely compliant with the reference implementation.

### Version
1.0.0

### Dependencies

Hydrangea has only two dependencies to work properly:

* [Flask] - ```pip install Flask```
* [Markdown] - ```pip install Markdown```

It also uses [Bootstrap], which is loaded directly by their CDN.
